Table 2 in the paper titled "High Pressure Chemical Looping Reforming Processes.."
by Sandvik, Kathe et. al. is the main design space in terms of predictor variables.

Firstly in general, there are duplicate files that end with the words "filtered"
Lets ignore these files in out analysis.

The predictor variables are defined below, all others are potential response variables that
we will use aggregation functions to analyze.

The following is a brief description of predictor variables in the excel files:
1. Temperature:
 Units: Celcius, four discrete values 1000, 1050, 1100, 1150 
The sheet names in excel files contain temperature information.

2. CO2 input to my system: This predictor variable is labelled "VARY 1 CO2 IN MIXED" in the excel files


3. H2O input to my system: This predictor variable is labelled "VARY 2 H2OIN MIXED" in the excel files

4. Fe2O3 flowrate: The numerical value for this variable is the first five digits in the excel file names
For example if the file name is "45000Fe2O3,50Support,1 atm,1000-1150C", for all
the data in this file, the predictor variable for Fe2O3 flowrate is 45000 (kmol/hr units)

5. ITCMO Support fraction: The numerical value for this variable is the first two digits in the excel file names after the first comma
For example if the file name is "45000Fe2O3,50Support,1 atm,1000-1150C", for all
the data in this file, the predictor variable for ITCMO support is 50 (% units)

6. Pressure: The numerical value for this variable is the first two digits in the excel file names after the second comma
For example if the file name is "45000Fe2O3,50Support,1 atm,1000-1150C", for all
the data in this file, the predictor variable value for pressure is 1 (atm units)

7. Factor compressor: Under the pressure variable above, there are two levels: namely
3 Compressors or 4 Compressors. This information can be obtained for all pressures of 10 atm in excel files

For example if the file name is "55000Fe2O3,50Support,10 atm,1000-1150C-3Comp", for all
the data in this file, the predictor variable value for pressure is 3 (compressors units)
